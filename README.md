# Buffer-Overflow-Hacking-Exercise
Perform buffer overflow attack to gain access of someone systems

In this exercise, we have to perform the buffer overflow, which is taking input string from scanf function. We have to change the control flow of the program, to execute a method which gain root user access. To implement this someone should have good understanding of stack organisation on an Intel x86/32 bit processor. 

I developed some firsthand experience with one of the methods commonly used to exploit security weaknesses in operationg systems and network servers. 

Learnt some debugger like gdb. We are provided with file bufbomb on which we have to perform a series of bufferoverflow attacks.
